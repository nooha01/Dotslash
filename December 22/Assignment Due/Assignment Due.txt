You were asked to assist Raksha in a recent assignment. Raksha has a set of array as input given by her teacher. She has to identify whether the set of number follows the pattern described below.

If the three adjacent numbers are in increasing then decreasing order then it satisfies the requirement and returns true.

Help Raksha produce (true/ false) the required outcomes for each case.

Input Format

The first input t would be the number of input cases.

The next t lines would each have the length of the array and an array nums[].

Constraints

n== nums.length

1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Output Format

true ,if the three adjacent numbers are in increasing then decreasing order.

false ,otherwise.

Sample Input 0

1
4
1 2 3 4
Sample Output 0

false
Explanation 0

There is no increasing then decreasing pattern in the sequence. All the numbers are in ascending order
